# OAEPIIP

This repository contains information to support participants in the Ocean Alkalinity Enhancement Pelagic Impact Intercomparison Project (OAEPIIP). Within this repository there are two guides 1) an R script for the calculation of the addition of NaHCO3 and NaOH solution to establish the â€œequilibrated treatment, and 2) a workflow for the statistical analysis of individual OAEPIIP datasets using Generalized Additive Mixed Models (GAMMs). This open-access workshop was created by authors of the OAEPIIP project for use of those involved in the OAEPIIP project.

The content of this workshop has been reviewed by the authors of the OAEPIIP. If you would like to suggest any modifications please contact aaron.ferderer@utas.edu.au or lennart.bach@utas.edu.au
